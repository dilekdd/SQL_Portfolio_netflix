  - Version: The dump file was created using PostgreSQL version 17.x. It is recommended to use the same or a compatible version to avoid issues during restoration.
  - PostgreSQL is a free and open-source database system. You can download it [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

### **Database Setup**
1. **Install PostgreSQL**:
   - If you donâ€™t have PostgreSQL installed, follow the [official installation guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

2. **Create a Database**:
   - Create a database where the dataset will be restored:
     ```bash
     psql -U your_username
     CREATE DATABASE netflix;
     \q
     ```

3. **Restore the Database**:
   - Use the provided `netflix_dump.sql` file to restore the database:

### **How to Run**
1. **Connect to the Database**:
   - Open your terminal and connect to the `netflix` database:
     ```bash
     psql -U your_username -d netflix
     ```

2. **Execute Queries**:
   - To execute queries directly, use:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM netflix_titles LIMIT 10;
     ```

   - Or execute queries from a file:
     ```bash
     \i path_to_query.sql
     ```

### **Notes**
1. **Missing Values**:
   - Some columns (e.g., `director`, `actors`, `country`, `date_added`) contain `NULL` values.
   - Missing values typically indicate unavailable or unknown information.

2. **Data Relationships**:
   - `media_type` categorizes the title as either "Movie" or "TV Show".
   - `duration` differs for movies and TV shows:
     - Movies: Duration in minutes (e.g., "90 min").
     - TV Shows: Number of seasons (e.g., "3 Seasons").

3. **Primary Key**:
   - `show_id` serves as the primary key for this dataset, ensuring each record is unique.

4. **Common Use Cases**:
   - Identifying trends in content releases by year or country.
   - Filtering content based on genres (`listed_in`) or ratings (`rating`).
   - Analyzing the popularity of actors and directors.
